Hello!

I'm Shane, a Statistics - Data Science student at The University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. I am originally from a small town called
Union City, Pennsylvania (just south of Erie) but am currently based in Akron. I am passionate about Statistics and Data Science
and have done some work with R, but outside of that, I am completely new to coding. I love Jazz and movies.
